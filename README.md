# MPI_2021-2022

* The year 2020 and 2021 must be tough for many people around the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Especially for international students like me, after the situation escalated, almost all of my classmates fled back to their homeland. However, studying and working abroad has always been my dream, and I don't want to give it up easily. Fortunately, I got a job a few months after graduating from QMUL and stayed in the UK.

* MPI (Materials Processing Institute) is a not-for-profit research and innovation centre with a 75-year track record in developing new materials, processes and technologies. Working as an IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) Engineer at the Institute, I am the first and principal worker with a relevant background and experience in the field.

* During my time at the Institute, I was involved in several projects, mainly focusing on optimizing the production processes of our clients using the latest digital technologies, such as Industrial 4.0 and Digital Twins. In other words, my job is to create a secure and efficient connection between the physical and digital worlds, which also means I have solid experience in both hardware and software.
